                    Presley's birthplace in Tupelo, Mississippi
                    Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Vernon Elvis and Gladys Love Presley in a two-room shotgun house that his father built for the occasion. Elvis's identical twin brother, Jesse Garon Presley, 
                    was delivered 35 minutes before him, stillborn. Presley became close to both parents and formed an especially close bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.

                    Presley's father, Vernon, was of German or Scottish origin. Through his mother, Presley was Scotch-Irish, with some French Norman ancestry. His mother, Gladys, and the rest of the family, apparently believed that her great-great-grandmother, 
                    Morning Dove White, was Cherokee; this was confirmed 
                    by Elvis's granddaughter Riley Keough in 2017. Elaine Dundy, in her biography, supports the belief—although one genealogy researcher has contested it on multiple grounds. 
                    Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family.

                    Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evincing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written 
                    by his landowner and sometime-employer. He was jailed for eight months, while Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives.

                    In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as "average". He was encouraged to enter a singing contest after impressing his schoolteacher with a rendition of Red Foley's country 
                    song "Old Shep" during morning prayers. The contest, held at the Mississippi–Alabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, was his first public performance. The ten-year-old Presley was dressed as a cowboy; he stood on a chair to reach the microphone and 
                    sang "Old Shep". He recalled placing fifth. A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday; he had hoped for something else—by different accounts, either a bicycle or a rifle. Over the following year, he 
                    received basic guitar lessons from two of his uncles and the new pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, "I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it."

                    In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade; he was regarded as a loner. The following year, he began bringing his guitar to school on a daily basis. He played and sang during lunchtime, and was often teased as a "trashy" 
                    kid who played hillbilly music. By then, the family was living in a largely black neighborhood. Presley was a devotee of Mississippi Slim's show on the Tupelo radio station WELO. He was described as "crazy about music" by Slim's younger brother, who was 
                    one of Presley's classmates and often took him into the station. Slim supplemented Presley's guitar instruction by demonstrating chord techniques. When his protégé was twelve years old, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time,
                    but succeeded in performing the following week.
